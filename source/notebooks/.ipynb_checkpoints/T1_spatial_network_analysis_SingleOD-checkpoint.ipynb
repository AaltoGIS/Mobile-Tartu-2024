    "Now as we have calculated the travel time for our edges. We still need to convert our nodes and edges into a directed graph, so that we can start using it for routing. There are easy-to-use functionalities for doing this in `pyrosm` and `osmnx`. \n",

    "As a background information, it is good to understand that our edges represents a `directed` network. This means that the information stored in `oneway` column will be used to determine the network structure for the edges based on the rules in that column. If the `oneway` is `'yes'`, it means that the street can be driven only to one direction, and if it is `None` or has a value `\"no\"`, then that road can be driven to both directions. This means that the tool will make new duplicate edge and reversing the from-id and to-id values in the `u` and `v` columns in the data. In addition, value `-1` in the `oneway` column means that the road can only be driven to one direction but **against** the digitization direction. In such cases, the edge is flipped: the *to-id* (`u`) and *from-id* (`u`) is reversed so that the directionality in the graph is correctly specified. "
