Workshop description
====================

Open scientific software and collaboration by coding have become important drivers for advancing Geospatial Data Science, and science in general. Open scientific tools and sharing analytical workflows with computational notebooks promote openness, collaboration, transparency and reproducibility, by making it easy for others to access and run the same analyses. This is essential not only for validating research results, but also for allowing scientists to build upon each other's work more efficiently, which can lead to faster progress and breakthroughs in a wide range of fields.

The open science and data-driven approaches have become integral part of research that investigates issues related to spatial accessibility and mobility. Computational approaches are important for understanding i) how well the current transport system promotes equitable and sustainable accessibility and mobility within planetary limits, as well as ii) being able to vision possible mobility and accessibility futures based on computational tools that allow generating future scenarios under given constraints and changes applied to the system. Ensuring equitable accessibility and mobility justice is critical to develop effective and widely acceptable net-zero policies, and therefore fundamental to bring about long lasting changes and prevent conflict.

This workshop aims at bringing to the forefront open scientific software, data-driven tools as well as other methodological advancements that support understanding and modelling accessibility and/or mobility and their linkages to social-environmental sustainability in urban or rural settings. Given the interdisciplinary nature of this topic, the workshop welcomes contributions by researchers coming from a wide range of backgrounds in a format that involves both short presentations and demo sessions.

------------

Participate
===========

We invite submissions of short research papers (1500-4000 words) or abstracts (200-500 words) that **describe novel open-source computational tools and methodological advancements** aligned with the general theme of the workshop of equitable and sustainable accessibility and mobility. All papers and abstracts will undergo peer-review with accepted papers being published online with a volume DOI (via the `Open Science Foundation <https://osf.io/>`__).

Participants in this workshop are invited to extend their contributions for submission to the **special issue of Computers, Environment and Urban Systems** on `Equitable and Socially Sustainable Mobility <https://platial.science/si2023>`__.

Submissions on a variety of topics are welcome including, but not limited to:

- Spatial and equity analysis of accessibility
- Mobility justice and sustainability
- Open tools for mobility analysis
- Equity considerations on micromobility and shared mobility
- Sustainable mobility and gender
- Accessibility and sustainable mobility for an ageing society
- New forms of data for the analysis of inequalities and sustainable mobility
- Data bias and sustainable mobility analysis
- Exploring the relationship between accessibility and active travel
- Travel modes and new forms of mobility data
- Inequalities in walkability or bikeability
- Equitable urban design
- Sustainable urban vitality and urban vibrancy

Submission guidelines
---------------------

Submissions of short research papers or abstract in a PDF format should be directly uploaded to the `easychair platform <https://easychair.org/cfp/EASM-OTESAMA23>`__ and should follow the `Lecture Notes in Computer Science <https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/springer-lecture-notes-in-computer-science/kzwwpvhwnvfj>`__ format.
