Instructions
============

In the Notebooks and the associated website, we have provided various datasets and tutorials for you that demonstrate how it is possible
to estimate **the environmental costs** of access and mobility in the Helsinki Region. The datasets include information about:

- The number of users that travel between specific locations in Helsinki Region
- The travel times by car and public transport between specific locations
- The associated GHG emissions by car and public transport between specific locations

In addition to these attributes, we have provided you Point of Interest data derived from OvertureMaps database that show the locations of specific services
in Helsinki Region.

During the workshop **the target is to work in small teams and analyze these datasets from a perspective that you find interesting**.
The datasets allow you to investigate various aspects of mobility and compare different travel modes and locations to each other (see "Introduction to Data" section/Notebook) and it is your task to invent
an interesting question that you want investigate based on this data.

Based on your analyses, **you should create a simple presentation where you present what you have found out**.
